    <p class="description">I am a developer with commercial experience and client-facing skills from my previous career as a solicitor.  I love learning new skills, understanding problems and working out solutions for end users. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Experience</h3>
    <p class="description">Most recently I worked as a junior developer in a large financial services firm.  I worked with senior developers finding and fixing bugs in various C# and VB repositories, writing tests and SQL queries. I learnt coding on training courses with TechReturners, Northcoders and Code Nation, as well as various online courses. </p>
    <p class="description"> Prior to changing career, I worked for in the legal profession as a private client solicitor.  My role involved advising clients, drafting legal documents and managing a caseload of client work. Before qualifying as a solicitor, I had various roles including: Fundraising Manager for an education charity; European Projects worker; au pair in France... </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Why I want to return to Tech</h3>
    <p class="description">I was made furloughed and made redundant in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic. I am keen to continue my career in tech and would love to work for an organisation with a supportive culture and Growth Mindset.  I am passionate about encouraging more girls into trying coding, so I set up a girls' code club at my daughter's primary school last year.  The more I learn, the more I want to show girls that learning to code can be fun and creative.</p>
