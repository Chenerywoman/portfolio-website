    <h3 class="sub-heading">About Me</h3>
    <div class="background container">
        <div class="returning container">
            <p>I am a developer with commercial experience and client-facing skills from my previous
                career
                as a solicitor. I love understanding problems and working out solutions for end users.</p>

            <p>I am a passionate life-long learner. Over the last few years, I have: retrained for a tech career;
                attended
                Spanish evening classes; obtained additional legal qualifications; followed various online
                courses,Â including
                Managing People and Intercultural Communication. </p>

            <p> I believe strongly in encouraging more girls to learn coding and consider a STEM career. With this in
                mind, with
                another parent, I set up and ran a girls' code club at my daughter's primary school last year. I am keen
                to get
                the club up and running again as soon as the current Covid restrictions allow.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Experience</h3>
    <div class="background container">
        <div class="experience container">
            <p>Most recently I worked as a junior developer in a large financial services firm. I worked with senior
                developers finding and fixing bugs in various C# and VB repositories, writing tests and SQL queries. I
                learnt coding on training courses with <a class="trainers"
                    href="https://www.techreturners.com/">TechReturners</a>, <a class="trainers"
                    href="https://northcoders.com/">Northcoders</a> and <a class="trainers"
                    href="https://wearecodenation.com/">Code Nation</a> as well as various online courses. </p>

            <p> Prior to changing career, I was a private client solicitor for 10 years. My role involved advising
                clients, drafting legal documents and managing a caseload of client work. Before qualifying as a
                solicitor, I had various roles including: Fundraising Manager for an education charity; European
                Projects worker, obtaining funding for and working on digital inclusion projects in Manchester;
                administrator in a university department.

            <p>I read Modern Languages for my first degree and have lived and worked in France, Italy and Australia.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">Why I want to return to Tech</h3>
    <div class="background container">
        <div class="returning container">
            <p>I was furloughed and made redundant in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic. I am keen to continue my
                career in tech and would love to work for an organisation with a supportive culture and Growth Mindset.
