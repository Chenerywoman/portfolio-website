# Portfolio webspage

## Created with HTML & CSS

This is my first portfolio website created with HTML and CSS.

In addition to HTML and CSS, I used:
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to put together a colour scheme;
* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)for the font;
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the github and twitter icons.

It is hosted at: https://chenerywoman.github.io/portfolio-website/.
